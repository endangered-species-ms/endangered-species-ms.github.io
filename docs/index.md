## Summary

_ESMS_ is a content management system designed to be used as an Android application for ease of
 use in the field, while traveling as well as in the office. A user, depending upon access rights, can 
 find and/or add/modify data regarding a given species of life. Personnel collect and organize data all 
 with the purpose of providing managers, administrators and legislators with the information needed 
 to determine the endangerment status of a species.

## Intended users &amp; user stories

* A field biologist.

    > As a field biologist specializing in studying the habitat, numbers etc. of endangered living organisms, the ease of 
using an app-based content management system to record and organize data would greatly improve the quantity and quality of
work I could accomplish.        
                        
* Department Head.

    > As a head of government department responsible for collecting, analyzing, and presenting data framed to make the case
that a given species should have a lawfully valid endangered designation, I need a easy to access and easy to use system
for managing both data collected and managing the personnel involved.

## ESMS details

- A user should have a secured account to access the application. 

	- The following are the types of accounts. 
		- VIEWER: The user can query the species data database to retrieve information. 
		- RESEARCHER: The user that can submit data, retrieve it for analysis and categorization, or return it to the 
		species data locker.
